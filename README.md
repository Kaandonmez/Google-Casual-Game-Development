### Assignment content

#### - All planets and meteors orbit around the sun according to the gravitational force. (Orbits are not regular yet)

#### - Camera movement pauses for 2 seconds when mouse is moved or left mouse click is pressed.

#### - Meteor object is created in a certain radius area when the left mouse button is pressed while the camera is moving.

#### - When the meteor collides with any object, the particle effect plays for 0.7 seconds, then the object is destroyed.

#### - Added trail to meteors.

#### - Clicking on an object (except meteor) opens a panel. The planet name (name in the hierarchy panel) and rigidbody mass are printed in the panel. The panel can be closed with the red button on the top right. (As long as the panel remains open, the camera does not move and the meteor cannot be created.)

#### - Created shader with shader graph for meteors and sun.

#### - The entire project has been converted to URP.

#### - All the criteria required in the previous assignment are also met here.

### Previous assignment content

#### All planets can rotate around themselves.
#### ~~3 planets orbit around the sun.~~(The number of planets has been increased.)

#### - ~~The radius of rotation of the planets, the speed of rotation around the sun and the direction of rotation can be adjusted.~~ (Planetary orbits dynamically respond to the position of other planets in the environment and the position of meteorites. Therefore, it is possible for now to see a planet sticking to the sun. :) )
#### - ~~In the same way,~~ the rotation direction and speed of all celestial bodies can be adjusted.
